## Thermodynamics - what exactly does it explain and how can it help me think about the world

I've always loved thermodynamics. I've always felt that it has, paradoxically, immense explanatory power but also that descriptions of it are prone to overstatement. The use of "arrow of time" in discussions of thermodynamics is often confusing to me. The second law of thermodynamics is sometimes said to answer the question: Which direction does the arrow of time point? But I don't like the framing of this question. I really can't overcome my intuition that, sitting in the present, there is only one direction that time can go. I feel that the more appropriate framing is something like: How is the future different from the present? This framing also helps me think about applications of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. At the microscopic scale, it's very common to observe things going in one direction and then the other. Of course, this is also common at the macroscopic scale!
