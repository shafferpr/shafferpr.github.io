Hi! I'm a computational scientist and software engineer. I like computational chemistry/ physics/ biology.
I am interested in the traditional approaches to these fields - Molecular Dynamics simulations,
PDE solvers, Markov Models, DFT, Monte Carlo simulations. But I can't shake a hunch that these fields
are in for a major shakeup from machine learning based approaches, and I try to pay attention to
the big developments in this area.

I also have an amateur interest in programming languages and programming abstractions. I like functional
programming and new efforts towards differentiable programming (jax, zygote). And I'm very interested in projects
working on new programming abstractions (unison, dex-lang, futhark).
